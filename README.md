# TODOIST HELPER

This project can help you very quickly add task to your todoist account!

## How To Use It

> First of all, you need to declare your API token.

- Go to your Todoist account > Settings > Integrations > API Token and copy it.

- Since you are in the directory, that contains this file, run this command:
```echo "API_TOKEN = 'PASTE_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE'" > todoist_helper/config.py```

> Install dependencies

- Run this command:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
Change ```pip``` to ```pip3``` if you need.

> Now, let's make it fast to use!

- Run this command:
```chmod +x quick_add.py```

- Create a keyboard shortcut:

- - Name: whatever you want
- - Command: /path/to/this/dir/quick_add.py
- - Shortcut: whatever you want (I use Shift-Ctrl-O)

> Setup finished!

- Hope you will enjoy this mini project!
